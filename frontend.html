        <p>During my Lucasfilm internship, I also helped redesign and implement frontend improvements to production websites using Figma, TypeScript, React, and Next.js.</p>
        <section>
            <p class="title">Website 1: Redesigning submissions page</p>
            <p>The first website I worked on enabled producers to review and edit takes in production environments. I was tasked with redesigning the submissions page, which is where the website would navigate to after the producers have submitted their takes.</p>
            <i>Initial Design</i>
            <div class="project_grid">
                <img class="images" src="media/submissions/initial_pr.PNG">
                <img class="images" src="media/submissions/initial_id.PNG">
            </div>
            <i>Issues:</i>
            <ul>
                <li>Multiple pages contain overlapping information, including status, id, and takes</li>
                <li>Unclear exact purpose of submit button</li>
                <li>Pull request never shown in the rest of the site</li>
                <li>List layout looked messy</li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>Mockup in Figma</i></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Combined the information into a single table</li>
                <li>Moved the submit button to the specific row in the table, which would be submitted (also renamed the button to "submit to farm" to make more understandable)</li>
                <li>Renamed title to "Submissions"</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="project_grid">
                <img class="images" src="media/submissions/figma.PNG">
            </div>
            <p><i>Feedback and Redesign Part Two</i></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The product manager liked the designs, but explained to me that one submission may include multiple sets of takes, each of which would have a different render ID and submissions stuatus.</li>
                <li>I knew that I wanted to keep the information on a single page and in a tabular format. Because render ID and submission status would be individual to each take within a submission, I extracted those into a sub table within the main submissions table.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>Final Implementation (using TypeScript, Tailwind)</i></p>
            <ul>
                <li>After confirming my updated design with the product manager, I implemented the changes in the website using TypeScript and Tailwind. The website is now used in production with my designs!</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="project_grid">

            <p class="title">Website 2: Color Accessibility and Header Redesign</p>
            <p>The second website I worked on was used to visualize a job's status in being rendered. Initially, I was tasked with just updating the header. However, after opening the site, I realized there were some problems with color accessibility for the site and asked to help out with that as well!</p>
            <p><i>Initial Design</i></p>
            <div class="project_grid">
                <img class="images" src="media/color/initial.PNG">
            </div>
            <i>Issues:</i>
            <ul>
                <li>Header formatting could use a pass to highlight useful information about the render job and user</li>
                <li>Colors aren't consistent with web accessibility standards</li>
                <li>Tooltip when hovering over nodes was ill-formatted (no background, just pure white text), overlapping with the nodes above it. Sorry I don't have an image :(</li>
            </ul>
            <i>Figma Mockup</i>
            <ul>
                <li>Here I mainly focused on creating a color palette that aligned with web accessibility standards. (first is original, second is my proposal)</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="project_grid">

                <li>See the updated color palette, the revised header, and the newly formatted tooltip!</li>
