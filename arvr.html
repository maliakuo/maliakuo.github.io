                <h2>Final Project: What's a bird?</h2>
                <p><i>Unity, C#, NomadSculpt, Procreate, construction paper, tape, white pastel</i></p>
                <p>My goal with my final project was to explore technology and how it relates to art and our perception of it. I chose to explore how many ways I could represent a bird in different mediums - ranging from pencil and paper to sculpture (both traditional and digital) to an interactive game. Below you can see these different explorations.</p>

                <p><i>I started by trying to sculpt a bird from construction paper and tape. Can you tell that this is my first time trying to make a physical 3d model of something? You can, because it's basically a ball of tape.</i></p>

                <p><i>After I made that sculpture, I did a quick still life using black construction paper and white pastel.</i></p>

                <p><i>Following my physical, tangible exploration, I thought it would be fun to try a 3D modeling software that I hadn't used before (NomadSculpt). This was a lot of fun. I modeled the bird, then made it transparent and glow from the inside, which would be so exciting to see in the wild.</i></p>

                <p><i>Once I saw that turntable, I knew that I wanted to explore a bird in motion. Using Procreate's animation feature, I made a quick gif of a bird walking. I feel like it's interesting to see how the personality of the bird takes on new levels just through movement.</i></p>

                <p><i>Finally, I was struck with the question - what if *we* were the bird? Using Unity, I modeled a basic bird model and created a custom controller to gameify the bird. The idea is that you are a bird, exploring this forest and flying or hopping around the ground.</i></p>
                <p><i>What I loved about this project was that it taught me not to be afraid of exploration and the inevitable hurdles that come from learning something new. It was a ton of fun, and I got to try my hand at a lot of different softwares that I still like using!</i></p>

                <h2>Group Project: Augmented Reality for Local New Haven Murals</h2>
                <p><i>Unity, C#</i></p>
                <p>The aim of this project was to craft an augmented reality experience in Unity that interacted with a local New Haven mural. The mural depicts the partnernship of New Haven bus drivers and essential workers in keeping the city safe during Covid. To this end, we first met with the artist to discuss their motivations and intention regarding the piece. Following this conversation, my group settled on our design and executed it, which involved an animated bus driving through the mural as well as flowers that appear as you interact with and move closer to the mural.</p>
                <p>We returned to the site with our final work (see below) and viewed our experience with the class and the artist. This was a really exciting first foray into augmented reality for me!</p>
