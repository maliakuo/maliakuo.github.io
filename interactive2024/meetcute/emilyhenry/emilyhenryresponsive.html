                    <p>Nora Stephens' life is books—she’s read them all—and she is not that type of heroine. Not the plucky one, not the laidback dream girl, and especially not the sweetheart. In fact, the only people Nora is a heroine for are her clients, for whom she lands enormous deals as a cutthroat literary agent, and her beloved little sister Libby. </p>
                    <p>Which is why she agrees to go to Sunshine Falls, North Carolina for the month of August when Libby begs her for a sisters’ trip away—with visions of a small town transformation for Nora, who she’s convinced needs to become the heroine in her own story. But instead of picnics in meadows, or run-ins with a handsome country doctor or bulging-forearmed bartender, Nora keeps bumping into Charlie Lastra, a bookish brooding editor from back in the city. It would be a meet-cute if not for the fact that they’ve met many times and it’s never been cute.</p>
                    <p>If Nora knows she’s not an ideal heroine, Charlie knows he’s nobody’s hero, but as they are thrown together again and again—in a series of coincidences no editor worth their salt would allow—what they discover might just unravel the carefully crafted stories they’ve written about themselves.</p>

                    <p>I should've been looking where I was going.</p>
                    <p>I shouldn't have worn such high heels, or had a martini on an empty stomach, or been reading a book that's giving me a surreal out-of-body experience.</p>
                    <p>Because some combination of those poor decisions leads to me barreling into someone. And we're not talking a casual <i>Oh, I clipped you on the shoulder-how adorably clumsy I am!</i> We're talking <i>"Holy shit! My nose!"</i></p>
                    <p>Which is what I hear in the moment that my ankles wobble, my balance is thrown off, and my gaze snaps up to a face belonging to none other than Charlie Lastra.</p>
                    <p>Right as I go down like a sack of potatoes.</p>

                <p>Augustus Everett is an acclaimed author of literary fiction. January Andrews writes bestselling romance. When she pens a happily ever after, he kills off his entire cast.</p>
                <p>They’re polar opposites.</p>
                <p>In fact, the only thing they have in common is that for the next three months, they're living in neighboring beach houses, broke, and bogged down with writer's block.</p>
                <p>Until, one hazy evening, one thing leads to another and they strike a deal designed to force them out of their creative ruts: Augustus will spend the summer writing something happy, and January will pen the next Great American Novel. She’ll take him on field trips worthy of any rom-com montage, and he’ll take her to interview surviving members of a backwoods death cult (obviously). Everyone will finish a book and no one will fall in love. Really.</p>

                <p>The Grump's deck was dark too, except for a one fluorescent bulb surrounded by clumsy moths, which is why I nearly screamed when something moved in the shadows.</p>
                <p>And by nearly screamed, I of course mean <i>definitely screamed.</i></p>
                <p>"Jesus!" The shadowy thing gasped and shot up from the chair where it had been sitting. And by shadowy thing, I of course mean <i>man who'd been chilling in the dark until I scared the shit out of him.</i>"What, what?" he demanded, like he expected me to announce that he was covered in scorpions.</p>
                <p>If he had been, this would be less awkward.</p>
                <p>"Nothing!" I said, still breathing hard from the surprise. "I didn't see you there!"</p>
                <p>"You didn't see me here?" he repeated. He gave a scratchy, disbelieving laugh. "Really? You didn't see me, on my own deck?"</p>
