        <h2>CUT TO: INT. FREESTYLE CLUB AT SKI LODGE, NEW YEAR’S EVE</h2>
        <p><i>The party is in full swing as Troy enters in a blazer and dress shirt, casually making his way through the crowd. Gabriella holds her book as she also shyly makes her way through the crowd as a partygoer tips an oversized hat in her direction.</i></p>
        <p>PARTYGOER:<br> Howdy, ma’am.</p>
        <p><i>Gabriella laughs, sits on a chair, and reads. <br>An emcee stands on stage with a teen boy and girl at the microphones beside him.</i></p>
        <p>EMCEE:<br> Alright! How about that for a couple of snowboarders?</p>
        <p><i>The audience cheers and the teens leave the stage.</i></p>
        <p>EMCEE:<br> Who's gonna rock the house next? Huh?</p>
        <p><i>The emcee steps off the stage. Troy yawns as two spotlights move around the crowd and land on Troy and Gabriella. Troy puts his hands up in protest. Gabriella looks up confused. Troy’s friends point at him and cheer in excitement.</i></p>
        <p>TROY:<br> I can’t sing. No you go.</p>
        <p><i>The emcee reaches a hand out to Gabriella.</i></p>
        <p>EMCEE:<br>And you! Yeah, come on.</p>
        <span style="background-color: gold;"><p><i>Another partygoer with a horned helmet and noisemaker pushes Gabriella up. Gabriella is nervously led to the stage.</i></p></span>
        <p>TROY:<br>Look, I don’t sing, I can’t sing. No guys…</p>
        <span style="background-color: gold;"><p><i>The boys with Troy push him onto the stage.</i></p></span>
        <p>PARTYGOER:<br> Get up there!</p>
        <p><i>The emcee gets on stage with Troy and Gabriella.</i></p>
        <p>EMCEE:<br> Hey, you know what? Someday, someday you guys might thank me for this.</p>
        <p><i>The emcee hands Troy a microphone. Gabriella holds her arms to her chest and looks away.</i></p>
        <p>EMCEE:<br> Or not…</p>
        <p><i>The emcee walks offstage. Troy puts the microphone on the stand. He reads the song lyrics off a monitor.</i></p>

        <h2>Start of Something New</h2>
        <p><i>(Troy sings as Gabriella looks away. He is about to leave the stage when she begins to sing. He turns back and harmonizes with her. The crowd around them begins to gather. Troy removes his blazer and partygoers cheer, dance, and clap in rythmn. They begin to build up confidence and smile. Troy leans his microphone stand as he sings. They raise their arms up on a high note. Troy dances and Gabriella nearly falls offstage, being pushed back on by the crowd. They both hold their microphones and look each other in the eye as they sing.)</i></p>
        <p><i>The emcee returns on stage and claps. Troy offers his hand to Gabriella.</i></p>
        <span style="background-color: gold;">
            <p>TROY:<br> Troy.</p>
            <p><i>Gabriella shakes his hand.</i></p>
            <p>GABRIELLA:<br> Gabriella.</p>
