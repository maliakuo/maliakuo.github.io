        <p>My freshman year of high school, there were three English classes located next to each other. While I was in my English block, I received a pass to go to the Vice Principal’s office, and as I was stepping out of the room, I accidentally hit someone with the door. It was [redacted], and I started apologizing profusely but he was like “oh it’s really no big deal at all”. We awkwardly walked in the same direction and he pointed at a slip in his had and I saw that we had the same Yellow Pass and he said “where are you off to?” and I was like borderline flustered because of the door thing and I was like “Oh [redacted]'s office” and he said “oh shit me too” and then we just talked about what it could be about on our way there, it was to inform us that we were in the running for Valedictorian as of the end of that year. And then [redacted] followed me on IG after. </p>
        <p>What ensued was the strangest dynamic of my life for four years and I can safely say that man may have very well been the love of my life but he only kissed boys while drunk and we only interact on Snap from time to time now so nothing concrete will stem from it, but it was such a fun little encounter that I thought it would be worth sharing.

        <p>In high school, my school had a semi formal to raise money for a prom around Valentines. I think it was Valentine's Day themed. Our school band was performing and they invited some other schools including [school] - their band was three guys and one girl, but she couldn't make it to the performance so they needed someone to fill-in. It was really last minute, so my school asked me to do it. I said OK, and I went to rehearse with them. The semiformal was for prom so when we were rehearsing, they were like oh so do we get automatic invites to your prom then? I implied that I would take one of them - the guitarist. It was like, haha I am taking [redacted] to prom. And then it was like no, I’m taking [redacted] to prom.</p>
        <p>He was really cool. I have a picture of us playing guitar in the band together. He was really tall and was playing guitar and he took a gap and ended up going to brown/risd which was really impressive. We all started hanging out a lot during senior spring when things started getting more fun and then Covid. So he was one of the people I was hanging out with before everything got shut down.</p>
        <p>For a second, we thought we were going to the same college cause I got into [college] early and [college] came out before ivies regular. We would go on zoom calls as a group and then he and I would just like hang on after for hours. He would say like oh well, we’ll just go to the [college] redemption prom together. Obviously that didn’t happen. We haven’t kept in touch so we didn’t end up dating. I think he would’ve been my first boyfriend though.</p>
        <p>One of the songs we did, I didn’t know before we did it together. It’s take me out by Franz Ferdinand and every time I hear it I think of him and the first line is “if you’re lonely, you know I’m here waiting for you.” And sometimes I think about that, that’s all.</p>

        <p>Not gonna lie, it was [redacted]. For me, it’s cute because it’s such a covid specific situation and yale covid specific situation. We met because we were part of the same froco group and of course everyone was isolated. They assigned coffee chats with other people in your froco group and you were meant to talk to them for maybe five minutes and on day two of that, or day 3/4 of being at yale, we were paired up. I was not interested in going to see him at all, I was like I don’t know who this dude is and I don’t really care so I passed him by at the time we were supposed to meet and asked if I could climb the tower real quick because that was something we all just did. So I made him wait and then I came down and he was still waiting for me, a little annoyed, but he was still there, and so we sat down. I was like, I’ll talk to this guy for five minutes. And then we sat down and starting talking - I thought I had nothing in common with him, but the coffee chat lasted for an hour and a half. It felt like it lasted five minutes, but it actually took up an hour and a half into dinnertime. It was really cute, an instant spark, and instant connection. I just had this feeling I would have something with this person. </p>

        <p>I really like the story of how I met [redacted] for the first time. It was [friend's] 21 and at the party I had met [other friend] and [other friend] and they lived in the big [residential college] suite. And they invited me and a couple other people to hang in their suite after and we were just watching a movie and hanging out when the rest of their suite came into the common room. We got up and everybody started introducing themselves and there was this guy [redacted]. 
            
        <p>I was like, "hi [redacted], I’m [redacted]" and it was so funny because he froze and whipped his head around and said "wait, say my name one more time." and I said "[redacted]?” "How did you say my name the arabic way?" he said. And it was just this really cool moment of connection because yeah I speak arabic, but you would not expect that from someone looking like me. As someone who also gets their name mispronounced  on the regular, I so understand the joy of coming across someone who says your name the way it was originally intended to be pronounced. It’s a moment that makes you light up.</p>

        <p> It sparked this really fun conversation and we had a really fun time  - he even noticed my necklace and was like did you get that necklace from Jordan and I was like yeah wait how did you know and he went, "I'm Jordanian!" and it was this really unexpected moment of connection that I never saw coming during a fun birthday evening. It left me with a really wonderful feeling and it’s funny because life took us on our own separate paths and after a year, we somehow reconnected and I found that kind of special.</p>

        <p>This story actually makes me look horrible, but basically before coming to Yale, I had met this dude online and we’d FaceTimed a couple of times. When I came to campus, he asked me out to boba. I knew that he probably wanted to be more than friends and I didn’t want that, so I asked if I could bring some friends too. He agreed.</p>
        <p>This was like the first couple weeks of college, so I went to our common room and asked if anyone wanted to get boba with me. Like fifteen people wanted to come. So I ended up showing up to this date with fifteen plus ones and he showed up with one other guy. The date ended up being me just going down the line of people that I brought from Morse to get to know them and one of them was this guy from California. We immediately hit it off and had a fun conversation. So I ended up meeting my boyfriend of two years on a date with another person. Rip.</p>
